       "'proteins are large biomolecules, or macromolecules, consisting of one or more long chains of amino acid residues. proteins perform a vast array of functions within organisms, including catalysing metabolic reactions, dna replication, responding to stimuli, providing structure to cells, and organisms, and transporting molecules from one location to another. proteins differ from one another primarily in their sequence of amino acids, which is dictated by the nucleotide sequence of their genes, and which usually results in protein folding into a specific 3d structure that determines its activity.\\n a linear chain of amino acid residues is called a polypeptide. a protein contains at least one long polypeptide. short polypeptides, containing less than 20–30 residues, are rarely considered to be proteins and are commonly called peptides, or sometimes oligopeptides. the individual amino acid residues are bonded together by peptide bonds and adjacent amino acid residues. the sequence of amino acid residues in a protein is defined by the sequence of a gene, which is encoded in the genetic code. in general, the genetic code specifies 20 standard amino acids; but in certain organisms the genetic code can include selenocysteine and—in certain archaea—pyrrolysine. shortly after or even during synthesis, the residues in a protein are often chemically modified by post-translational modification, which alters the physical and chemical properties, folding, stability, activity, and ultimately, the function of the proteins. some proteins have non-peptide groups attached, which can be called prosthetic groups or cofactors. proteins can also work together to achieve a particular function, and they often associate to form stable protein complexes.\\n once formed, proteins only exist for a certain period and are then degraded and recycled by the cell\\'s machinery through the process of protein turnover. a protein\\'s lifespan is measured in terms of its half-life and covers a wide range. they can exist for minutes or years with an average lifespan of 1–2 days in mammalian cells. abnormal or misfolded proteins are degraded more rapidly either due to being targeted for destruction or due to being unstable.\\n like other biological macromolecules such as polysaccharides and nucleic acids, proteins are essential parts of organisms and participate in virtually every process within cells. many proteins are enzymes that catalyse biochemical reactions and are vital to metabolism. proteins also have structural or mechanical functions, such as actin and myosin in muscle and the proteins in the cytoskeleton, which form a system of scaffolding that maintains cell shape. other proteins are important in cell signaling, immune responses, cell adhesion, and the cell cycle. in animals, proteins are needed in the diet to provide the essential amino acids that cannot be synthesized. digestion breaks the proteins down for use in the metabolism.\\n proteins may be purified from other cellular components using a variety of techniques such as ultracentrifugation, precipitation, electrophoresis, and chromatography; the advent of genetic engineering has made possible a number of methods to facilitate purification. methods commonly used to study protein structure and function include immunohistochemistry, site-directed mutagenesis, x-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry.\\n \\n \\n == history and etymology ==\\n \\n proteins were recognized as a distinct class of biological molecules in the eighteenth century by antoine fourcroy and others, distinguished by the molecules\\' ability to coagulate or flocculate under treatments with heat or acid. noted examples at the time included albumin from egg whites, blood serum albumin, fibrin, and wheat gluten.\\n proteins were first described by the dutch chemist gerardus johannes mulder and named by the swedish chemist jöns jacob berzelius in 1838. mulder carried out elemental analysis of common proteins and found that nearly all proteins had the same empirical formula, c400h620n100o120p1s1. he came to the erroneous conclusion that they might be composed of a single type of (very large) molecule. the term \"protein\" to describe these molecules was proposed by mulder\\'s associate berzelius; protein is derived from the greek word πρώτειος (proteios), meaning \"primary\", \"in the lead\", or \"standing in front\", + -in. mulder went on to identify the products of protein degradation such as the amino acid leucine for which he found a (nearly correct) molecular weight of 131 da. prior to \"protein\", other names were used, like \"albumins\" or \"albuminous materials\" (eiweisskörper, in german).early nutritional scientists such as the german carl von voit believed that protein was the most important nutrient for maintaining the structure of the body, because it was generally believed that \"flesh makes flesh.\" karl heinrich ritthausen extended known protein forms with the identification of glutamic acid. at the connecticut agricultural experiment station a detailed review of the vegetable proteins was compiled by thomas burr osborne. working with lafayette mendel and applying liebig\\'s law of the minimum in feeding laboratory rats, the nutritionally essential amino acids were established. the work was continued and communicated by william cumming rose. the understanding of proteins as polypeptides came through the work of franz hofmeister and hermann emil fischer in 1902. the central role of proteins as enzymes in living organisms was not fully appreciated until 1926, when james b. sumner showed that the enzyme urease was in fact a protein.the difficulty in purifying proteins in large quantities made them very difficult for early protein biochemists to study. hence, early studies focused on proteins that could be purified in large quantities, e.g., those of blood, egg white, various toxins, and digestive/metabolic enzymes obtained from slaughterhouses. in the 1950s, the armour hot dog co. purified 1 kg of pure bovine pancreatic ribonuclease a and made it freely available to scientists; this gesture helped ribonuclease a become a major target for biochemical study for the following decades.\\n \\n linus pauling is credited with the successful prediction of regular protein secondary structures based on hydrogen bonding, an idea first put forth by william astbury in 1933. later work by walter kauzmann on denaturation, based partly on previous studies by kaj linderstrøm-lang, contributed an understanding of protein folding and structure mediated by hydrophobic interactions.\\n the first protein to be sequenced was insulin, by frederick sanger, in 1949. sanger correctly determined the amino acid sequence of insulin, thus conclusively demonstrating that proteins consisted of linear polymers of amino acids rather than branched chains, colloids, or cyclols. he won the nobel prize for this achievement in 1958.the first protein structures to be solved were hemoglobin and myoglobin, by max perutz and sir john cowdery kendrew, respectively, in 1958. as of 2017, the protein data bank has over 126,060 atomic-resolution structures of proteins. in more recent times, cryo-electron microscopy of large macromolecular assemblies and computational protein structure prediction of small protein domains are two methods approaching atomic resolution.\\n \\n \\n == biochemistry ==\\n \\n most proteins consist of linear polymers built from series of up to 20 different l-α- amino acids. all proteinogenic amino acids possess common structural features, including an α-carbon to which an amino group, a carboxyl group, and a variable side chain are bonded. only proline differs from this basic structure as it contains an unusual ring to the n-end amine group, which forces the co–nh amide moiety into a fixed conformation. the side chains of the standard amino acids, detailed in the list of standard amino acids, have a great variety of chemical structures and properties; it is the combined effect of all of the amino acid side chains in a protein that ultimately determines its three-dimensional structure and its chemical reactivity.\\n the amino acids in a polypeptide chain are linked by peptide bonds. once linked in the protein chain, an individual amino acid is called a residue, and the linked series of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen atoms are known as the main chain or protein backbone.the peptide bond has two resonance forms that contribute some double-bond character and inhibit rotation around its axis, so that the alpha carbons are roughly coplanar. the other two dihedral angles in the peptide bond determine the local shape assumed by the protein backbone. the end with a free amino group is known as the n-terminus or amino terminus, whereas the end of the protein with a free carboxyl group is known as the c-terminus or carboxy terminus (the sequence of the protein is written from n-terminus to c-terminus, from left to right).\\n the words protein, polypeptide, and peptide are a little ambiguous and can overlap in meaning. protein is generally used to refer to the complete biological molecule in a stable conformation, whereas peptide is generally reserved for a short amino acid oligomers often lacking a stable 3d structure. but the boundary between the two is not well defined and usually lies near 20–30 residues. polypeptide can refer to any single linear chain of amino acids, usually regardless of length, but often implies an absence of a defined conformation.\\n \\n \\n === interactions ===\\n proteins can interact with many types of molecules, including with other proteins, with lipids, with carboyhydrates, and with dna.\\n \\n \\n === abundance in cells ===\\n it has been estimated that average-sized bacteria contain about 2 million proteins per cell (e.g. e. coli and staphylococcus aureus). smaller bacteria, such as mycoplasma or spirochetes contain fewer molecules, on the order of 50,000 to 1 million. by contrast, eukaryotic cells are larger and thus contain much more protein. for instance, yeast cells have been estimated to contain about 50 million proteins and human cells on the order of 1 to 3 billion. the concentration of individual protein copies ranges from a few molecules per cell up to  20 million. not all genes coding proteins are expressed in most cells and their number depends on, for example, cell type and external stimuli. for instance, of the 20,000 or so proteins encoded by the human genome, only 6,000 are detected in lymphoblastoid cells. moreover, the number of proteins the genome encodes correlates well with the organism complexity. eukaryotes have 15,000, bacteria have 3,200, archaea have 2,400, and viruses have 42 proteins on average coded in their respective genomes.\\n \\n \\n == synthesis ==\\n \\n \\n === biosynthesis ===\\n \\n proteins are assembled from amino acids using information encoded in genes. each protein has its own unique amino acid sequence that is specified by the nucleotide sequence of the gene encoding this protein. the genetic code is a set of three-nucleotide sets called codons and each three-nucleotide combination designates an amino acid, for example aug (adenine–uracil–guanine) is the code for methionine. because dna contains four nucleotides, the total number of possible codons is 64; hence, there is some redundancy in the genetic code, with some amino acids specified by more than one codon. genes encoded in dna are first transcribed into pre-messenger rna (mrna) by proteins such as rna polymerase. most organisms then process the pre-mrna (also known as a primary transcript) using various forms of post-transcriptional modification to form the mature mrna, which is then used as a template for protein synthesis by the ribosome. in prokaryotes the mrna may either be used as soon as it is produced, or be bound by a ribosome after having moved away from the nucleoid. in contrast, eukaryotes make mrna in the cell nucleus and then translocate it across the nuclear membrane into the cytoplasm, where protein synthesis then takes place. the rate of protein synthesis is higher in prokaryotes than eukaryotes and can reach up to 20 amino acids per second.the process of synthesizing a protein from an mrna template is known as translation. the mrna is loaded onto the ribosome and is read three nucleotides at a time by matching each codon to its base pairing anticodon located on a transfer rna molecule, which carries the amino acid corresponding to the codon it recognizes. the enzyme aminoacyl trna synthetase \"charges\" the trna molecules with the correct amino acids. the growing polypeptide is often termed the nascent chain. proteins are always biosynthesized from n-terminus to c-terminus.the size of a synthesized protein can be measured by the number of amino acids it contains and by its total molecular mass, which is normally reported in units of daltons (synonymous with atomic mass units), or the derivative unit kilodalton (kda). the average size of a protein increases from archaea to bacteria to eukaryote (283, 311, 438 residues and 31, 34, 49 kda respectively) due to a bigger number of protein domains constituting proteins in higher organisms. for instance, yeast proteins are on average 466 amino acids long and 53 kda in mass. the largest known proteins are the titins, a component of the muscle sarcomere, with a molecular mass of almost 3,000 kda and a total length of almost 27,000 amino acids.\\n \\n \\n === chemical synthesis ===\\n \\n short proteins can also be synthesized chemically by a family of methods known as peptide synthesis, which rely on organic synthesis techniques such as chemical ligation to produce peptides in high yield. chemical synthesis allows for the introduction of non-natural amino acids into polypeptide chains, such as attachment of fluorescent probes to amino acid side chains. these methods are useful in laboratory biochemistry and cell biology, though generally not for commercial applications. chemical synthesis is inefficient for polypeptides longer than about 300 amino acids, and the synthesized proteins may not readily assume their native tertiary structure. most chemical synthesis methods proceed from c-terminus to n-terminus, opposite the biological reaction.\\n \\n \\n == structure ==\\n \\n most proteins fold into unique 3d structures. the shape into which a protein naturally folds is known as its native conformation. although many proteins can fold unassisted, simply through the chemical properties of their amino acids, others require the aid of molecular chaperones to fold into their native states. biochemists often refer to four distinct aspects of a protein\\'s structure:\\n primary structure: the amino acid sequence. a protein is a polyamide.\\n secondary structure: regularly repeating local structures stabilized by hydrogen bonds. the most common examples are the α-helix, β-sheet and turns. because secondary structures are local, many regions of different secondary structure can be present in the same protein molecule.\\n tertiary structure: the overall shape of a single protein molecule; the spatial relationship of the secondary structures to one another. tertiary structure is generally stabilized by nonlocal interactions, most commonly the formation of a hydrophobic core, but also through salt bridges, hydrogen bonds, disulfide bonds, and even posttranslational modifications. the term \"tertiary structure\" is often used as synonymous with the term fold. the tertiary structure is what controls the basic function of the protein.\\n quaternary structure: the structure formed by several protein molecules (polypeptide chains), usually called protein subunits in this context, which function as a single protein complex.\\n quinary structure: the signatures of protein surface that organize the crowded cellular interior. quinary structure is dependent on transient, yet essential, macromolecular interactions that occur inside living cells.proteins are not entirely rigid molecules. in addition to these levels of structure, proteins may shift between several related structures while they perform their functions. in the context of these functional rearrangements, these tertiary or quaternary structures are usually referred to as \"conformations\", and transitions between them are called conformational changes. such changes are often induced by the binding of a substrate molecule to an enzyme\\'s active site, or the physical region of the protein that participates in chemical catalysis. in solution proteins also undergo variation in structure through thermal vibration and the collision with other molecules.\\n \\n proteins can be informally divided into three main classes, which correlate with typical tertiary structures: globular proteins, fibrous proteins, and membrane proteins. almost all globular proteins are soluble and many are enzymes. fibrous proteins are often structural, such as collagen, the major component of connective tissue, or keratin, the protein component of hair and nails. membrane proteins often serve as receptors or provide channels for polar or charged molecules to pass through the cell membrane.a special case of intramolecular hydrogen bonds within proteins, poorly shielded from water attack and hence promoting their own dehydration, are called dehydrons.\\n \\n \\n === protein domains ===\\n \\n many proteins are composed of several protein domains, i.e. segments of a protein that fold into distinct structural units. domains usually also have specific functions, such as enzymatic activities (e.g. kinase) or they serve as binding modules (e.g. the sh3 domain binds to proline-rich sequences in other proteins).\\n \\n \\n === sequence motif ===\\n short amino acid sequences within proteins often act as recognition sites for other proteins. for instance, sh3 domains typically bind to short pxxp motifs (i.e. 2 prolines [p], separated by two unspecified amino acids [x], although the surrounding amino acids may determine the exact binding specificity). many such motifs has been collected in the eukaryotic linear motif (elm) database.\\n \\n \\n == cellular functions ==\\n proteins are the chief actors within the cell, said to be carrying out the duties specified by the information encoded in genes. with the exception of certain types of rna, most other biological molecules are relatively inert elements upon which proteins act. proteins make up half the dry weight of an escherichia coli cell, whereas other macromolecules such as dna and rna make up only 3% and 20%, respectively. the set of proteins expressed in a particular cell or cell type is known as its proteome.\\n \\n the chief characteristic of proteins that also allows their diverse set of functions is their ability to bind other molecules specifically and tightly. the region of the protein responsible for binding another molecule is known as the binding site and is often a depression or \"pocket\" on the molecular surface. this binding ability is mediated by the tertiary structure of the protein, which defines the binding site pocket, and by the chemical properties of the surrounding amino acids\\' side chains. protein binding can be extraordinarily tight and specific; for example, the ribonuclease inhibitor protein binds to human angiogenin with a sub-femtomolar dissociation constant (<10−15 m) but does not bind at all to its amphibian homolog onconase (>1 m). extremely minor chemical changes such as the addition of a single methyl group to a binding partner can sometimes suffice to nearly eliminate binding; for example, the aminoacyl trna synthetase specific to the amino acid valine discriminates against the very similar side chain of the amino acid isoleucine.proteins can bind to other proteins as well as to small-molecule substrates. when proteins bind specifically to other copies of the same molecule, they can oligomerize to form fibrils; this process occurs often in structural proteins that consist of globular monomers that self-associate to form rigid fibers. protein–protein interactions also regulate enzymatic activity, control progression through the cell cycle, and allow the assembly of large protein complexes that carry out many closely related reactions with a common biological function. proteins can also bind to, or even be integrated into, cell membranes. the ability of binding partners to induce conformational changes in proteins allows the construction of enormously complex signaling networks.\\n as interactions between proteins are reversible, and depend heavily on the availability of different groups of partner proteins to form aggregates that are capable to carry out discrete sets of function, study of the interactions between specific proteins is a key to understand important aspects of cellular function, and ultimately the properties that distinguish particular cell types.\\n \\n \\n === enzymes ===\\n \\n the best-known role of proteins in the cell is as enzymes, which catalyse chemical reactions. enzymes are usually highly specific and accelerate only one or a few chemical reactions. enzymes carry out most of the reactions involved in metabolism, as well as manipulating dna in processes such as dna replication, dna repair, and transcription. some enzymes act on other proteins to add or remove chemical groups in a process known as posttranslational modification. about 4,000 reactions are known to be catalysed by enzymes. the rate acceleration conferred by enzymatic catalysis is often enormous—as much as 1017-fold increase in rate over the uncatalysed reaction in the case of orotate decarboxylase (78 million years without the enzyme, 18 milliseconds with the enzyme).the molecules bound and acted upon by enzymes are called substrates. although enzymes can consist of hundreds of amino acids, it is usually only a small fraction of the residues that come in contact with the substrate, and an even smaller fraction—three to four residues on average—that are directly involved in catalysis. the region of the enzyme that binds the substrate and contains the catalytic residues is known as the active site.\\n dirigent proteins are members of a class of proteins that dictate the stereochemistry of a compound synthesized by other enzymes.\\n \\n \\n === cell signaling and ligand binding ===\\n \\n many proteins are involved in the process of cell signaling and signal transduction. some proteins, such as insulin, are extracellular proteins that transmit a signal from the cell in which they were synthesized to other cells in distant tissues. others are membrane proteins that act as receptors whose main function is to bind a signaling molecule and induce a biochemical response in the cell. many receptors have a binding site exposed on the cell surface and an effector domain within the cell, which may have enzymatic activity or may undergo a conformational change detected by other proteins within the cell.antibodies are protein components of an adaptive immune system whose main function is to bind antigens, or foreign substances in the body, and target them for destruction. antibodies can be secreted into the extracellular environment or anchored in the membranes of specialized b cells known as plasma cells. whereas enzymes are limited in their binding affinity for their substrates by the necessity of conducting their reaction, antibodies have no such constraints. an antibody\\'s binding affinity to its target is extraordinarily high.many ligand transport proteins bind particular small biomolecules and transport them to other locations in the body of a multicellular organism. these proteins must have a high binding affinity when their ligand is present in high concentrations, but must also release the ligand when it is present at low concentrations in the target tissues. the canonical example of a ligand-binding protein is haemoglobin, which transports oxygen from the lungs to other organs and tissues in all vertebrates and has close homologs in every biological kingdom. lectins are sugar-binding proteins which are highly specific for their sugar moieties. lectins typically play a role in biological recognition phenomena involving cells and proteins. receptors and hormones are highly specific binding proteins.\\n transmembrane proteins can also serve as ligand transport proteins that alter the permeability of the cell membrane to small molecules and ions. the membrane alone has a hydrophobic core through which polar or charged molecules cannot diffuse. membrane proteins contain internal channels that allow such molecules to enter and exit the cell. many ion channel proteins are specialized to select for only a particular ion; for example, potassium and sodium channels often discriminate for only one of the two ions.\\n \\n \\n === structural proteins ===\\n structural proteins confer stiffness and rigidity to otherwise-fluid biological components. most structural proteins are fibrous proteins; for example, collagen and elastin are critical components of connective tissue such as cartilage, and keratin is found in hard or filamentous structures such as hair, nails, feathers, hooves, and some animal shells. some globular proteins can also play structural functions, for example, actin and tubulin are globular and soluble as monomers, but polymerize to form long, stiff fibers that make up the cytoskeleton, which allows the cell to maintain its shape and size.\\n other proteins that serve structural functions are motor proteins such as myosin, kinesin, and dynein, which are capable of generating mechanical forces. these proteins are crucial for cellular motility of single celled organisms and the sperm of many multicellular organisms which reproduce sexually. they also generate the forces exerted by contracting muscles and play essential roles in intracellular transport.\\n \\n \\n == methods of study ==\\n \\n the activities and structures of proteins may be examined in vitro, in vivo, and in silico. in vitro studies of purified proteins in controlled environments are useful for learning how a protein carries out its function: for example, enzyme kinetics studies explore the chemical mechanism of an enzyme\\'s catalytic activity and its relative affinity for various possible substrate molecules. by contrast, in vivo experiments can provide information about the physiological role of a protein in the context of a cell or even a whole organism. in silico studies use computational methods to study proteins.\\n \\n \\n === protein purification ===\\n \\n to perform in vitro analysis, a protein must be purified away from other cellular components. this process usually begins with cell lysis, in which a cell\\'s membrane is disrupted and its internal contents released into a solution known as a crude lysate. the resulting mixture can be purified using ultracentrifugation, which fractionates the various cellular components into fractions containing soluble proteins; membrane lipids and proteins; cellular organelles, and nucleic acids. precipitation by a method known as salting out can concentrate the proteins from this lysate. various types of chromatography are then used to isolate the protein or proteins of interest based on properties such as molecular weight, net charge and binding affinity. the level of purification can be monitored using various types of gel electrophoresis if the desired protein\\'s molecular weight and isoelectric point are known, by spectroscopy if the protein has distinguishable spectroscopic features, or by enzyme assays if the protein has enzymatic activity. additionally, proteins can be isolated according to their charge using electrofocusing.for natural proteins, a series of purification steps may be necessary to obtain protein sufficiently pure for laboratory applications. to simplify this process, genetic engineering is often used to add chemical features to proteins that make them easier to purify without affecting their structure or activity. here, a \"tag\" consisting of a specific amino acid sequence, often a series of histidine residues (a \"his-tag\"), is attached to one terminus of the protein. as a result, when the lysate is passed over a chromatography column containing nickel, the histidine residues ligate the nickel and attach to the column while the untagged components of the lysate pass unimpeded. a number of different tags have been developed to help researchers purify specific proteins from complex mixtures.\\n \\n \\n === cellular localization ===\\n \\n the study of proteins in vivo is often concerned with the synthesis and localization of the protein within the cell. although many intracellular proteins are synthesized in the cytoplasm and membrane-bound or secreted proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum, the specifics of how proteins are targeted to specific organelles or cellular structures is often unclear. a useful technique for assessing cellular localization uses genetic engineering to express in a cell a fusion protein or chimera consisting of the natural protein of interest linked to a \"reporter\" such as green fluorescent protein (gfp). the fused protein\\'s position within the cell can be cleanly and efficiently visualized using microscopy, as shown in the figure opposite.\\n other methods for elucidating the cellular location of proteins requires the use of known compartmental markers for regions such as the er, the golgi, lysosomes or vacuoles, mitochondria, chloroplasts, plasma membrane, etc. with the use of fluorescently tagged versions of these markers or of antibodies to known markers, it becomes much simpler to identify the localization of a protein of interest. for example, indirect immunofluorescence will allow for fluorescence colocalization and demonstration of location. fluorescent dyes are used to label cellular compartments for a similar purpose.other possibilities exist, as well. for example, immunohistochemistry usually utilizes an antibody to one or more proteins of interest that are conjugated to enzymes yielding either luminescent or chromogenic signals that can be compared between samples, allowing for localization information. another applicable technique is cofractionation in sucrose (or other material) gradients using isopycnic centrifugation. while this technique does not prove colocalization of a compartment of known density and the protein of interest, it does increase the likelihood, and is more amenable to large-scale studies.\\n finally, the gold-standard method of cellular localization is immunoelectron microscopy. this technique also uses an antibody to the protein of interest, along with classical electron microscopy techniques. the sample is prepared for normal electron microscopic examination, and then treated with an antibody to the protein of interest that is conjugated to an extremely electro-dense material, usually gold. this allows for the localization of both ultrastructural details as well as the protein of interest.through another genetic engineering application known as site-directed mutagenesis, researchers can alter the protein sequence and hence its structure, cellular localization, and susceptibility to regulation. this technique even allows the incorporation of unnatural amino acids into proteins, using modified trnas, and may allow the rational design of new proteins with novel properties.\\n \\n \\n === proteomics ===\\n \\n the total complement of proteins present at a time in a cell or cell type is known as its proteome, and the study of such large-scale data sets defines the field of proteomics, named by analogy to the related field of genomics. key experimental techniques in proteomics include 2d electrophoresis, which allows the separation of many proteins, mass spectrometry, which allows rapid high-throughput identification of proteins and sequencing of peptides (most often after in-gel digestion), protein microarrays, which allow the detection of the relative levels of the various proteins present in a cell, and two-hybrid screening, which allows the systematic exploration of protein–protein interactions. the total complement of biologically possible such interactions is known as the interactome. a systematic attempt to determine the structures of proteins representing every possible fold is known as structural genomics.\\n \\n \\n === bioinformatics ===\\n \\n a vast array of computational methods have been developed to analyze the structure, function and evolution of proteins.\\n the development of such tools has been driven by the large amount of genomic and proteomic data available for a variety of organisms, including the human genome. it is simply impossible to study all proteins experimentally, hence only a few are subjected to laboratory experiments while computational tools are used to extrapolate to similar proteins. such homologous proteins can be efficiently identified in distantly related organisms by sequence alignment. genome and gene sequences can be searched by a variety of tools for certain properties. sequence profiling tools can find restriction enzyme sites, open reading frames in nucleotide sequences, and predict secondary structures. phylogenetic trees can be constructed and evolutionary hypotheses developed using special software like clustalw regarding the ancestry of modern organisms and the genes they express. the field of bioinformatics is now indispensable for the analysis of genes and proteins.\\n \\n \\n === structure determination ===\\n discovering the tertiary structure of a protein, or the quaternary structure of its complexes, can provide important clues about how the protein performs its function and how it can be affected, i.e. in drug design. as proteins are too small to be seen under a light microscope, other methods have to be employed to determine their structure. common experimental methods include x-ray crystallography and nmr spectroscopy, both of which can produce structural information at atomic resolution. however, nmr experiments are able to provide information from which a subset of distances between pairs of atoms can be estimated, and the final possible conformations for a protein are determined by solving a distance geometry problem. dual polarisation interferometry is a quantitative analytical method for measuring the overall protein conformation and conformational changes due to interactions or other stimulus. circular dichroism is another laboratory technique for determining internal β-sheet / α-helical composition of proteins. cryoelectron microscopy is used to produce lower-resolution structural information about very large protein complexes, including assembled viruses; a variant known as electron crystallography can also produce high-resolution information in some cases, especially for two-dimensional crystals of membrane proteins. solved structures are usually deposited in the protein data bank (pdb), a freely available resource from which structural data about thousands of proteins can be obtained in the form of cartesian coordinates for each atom in the protein.many more gene sequences are known than protein structures. further, the set of solved structures is biased toward proteins that can be easily subjected to the conditions required in x-ray crystallography, one of the major structure determination methods. in particular, globular proteins are comparatively easy to crystallize in preparation for x-ray crystallography. membrane proteins and large protein complexes, by contrast, are difficult to crystallize and are underrepresented in the pdb. structural genomics initiatives have attempted to remedy these deficiencies by systematically solving representative structures of major fold classes. protein structure prediction methods attempt to provide a means of generating a plausible structure for proteins whose structures have not been experimentally determined.\\n \\n \\n === structure prediction and simulation ===\\n \\n complementary to the field of structural genomics, protein structure prediction develops efficient mathematical models of proteins to computationally predict the molecular formations in theory, instead of detecting structures with laboratory observation. the most successful type of structure prediction, known as homology modeling, relies on the existence of a \"template\" structure with sequence similarity to the protein being modeled; structural genomics\\' goal is to provide sufficient representation in solved structures to model most of those that remain. although producing accurate models remains a challenge when only distantly related template structures are available, it has been suggested that sequence alignment is the bottleneck in this process, as quite accurate models can be produced if a \"perfect\" sequence alignment is known. many structure prediction methods have served to inform the emerging field of protein engineering, in which novel protein folds have already been designed. a more complex computational problem is the prediction of intermolecular interactions, such as in molecular docking and protein–protein interaction prediction.mathematical models to simulate dynamic processes of protein folding and binding involve molecular mechanics, in particular, molecular dynamics. monte carlo techniques facilitate the computations, which exploit advances in parallel and distributed computing (for example, the folding@home project which performs molecular modeling on gpus). in silico simulations discovered the folding of small α-helical protein domains such as the villin headpiece and the hiv accessory protein. hybrid methods combining standard molecular dynamics with quantum mechanical mathematics explored the electronic states of rhodopsins.\\n \\n \\n ==== protein disorder and unstructure prediction ====\\n many proteins (in eucaryota ~33%) contain large unstructured but biologically functional segments and can be classified as intrinsically disordered proteins. predicting and analysing protein disorder is, therefore, an important part of protein structure characterisation.\\n \\n \\n == nutrition ==\\n \\n most microorganisms and plants can biosynthesize all 20 standard amino acids, while animals (including humans) must obtain some of the amino acids from the diet. the amino acids that an organism cannot synthesize on its own are referred to as essential amino acids. key enzymes that synthesize certain amino acids are not present in animals—such as aspartokinase, which catalyses the first step in the synthesis of lysine, methionine, and threonine from aspartate. if amino acids are present in the environment, microorganisms can conserve energy by taking up the amino acids from their surroundings and downregulating their biosynthetic pathways.\\n in animals, amino acids are obtained through the consumption of foods containing protein. ingested proteins are then broken down into amino acids through digestion, which typically involves denaturation of the protein through exposure to acid and hydrolysis by enzymes called proteases. some ingested amino acids are used for protein biosynthesis, while others are converted to glucose through gluconeogenesis, or fed into the citric acid cycle. this use of protein as a fuel is particularly important under starvation conditions as it allows the body\\'s own proteins to be used to support life, particularly those found in muscle.in animals such as dogs and cats, protein maintains the health and quality of the skin by promoting hair follicle growth and keratinization, and thus reducing the likelihood of skin problems producing malodours. poor-quality proteins also have a role regarding gastrointestinal health, increasing the potential for flatulence and odorous compounds in dogs because when proteins reach the colon in an undigested state, they are fermented producing hydrogen sulfide gas, indole, and skatole. dogs and cats digest animal proteins better than those from plants, but products of low-quality animal origin are poorly digested, including skin, feathers, and connective tissue.\\n \\n \\n == see also ==\\n \\n \\n == references ==\\n \\n \\n == textbooks ==\\n \\n \\n == external links ==\\n

       "'proteins are large biomolecules  or macromolecules  consisting of one or more long chains of amino acid residues  proteins perform a vast array of functions within organisms  including catalysing metabolic reactions  dna replication  responding to stimuli  providing structure to cells  and organisms  and transporting molecules from one location to another  proteins differ from one another primarily in their sequence of amino acids  which is dictated by the nucleotide sequence of their genes  and which usually results in protein folding into a specific 3d structure that determines its activity   a linear chain of amino acid residues is called a polypeptide  a protein contains at least one long polypeptide  short polypeptides  containing less than 20–30 residues  are rarely considered to be proteins and are commonly called peptides  or sometimes oligopeptides  the individual amino acid residues are bonded together by peptide bonds and adjacent amino acid residues  the sequence of amino acid residues in a protein is defined by the sequence of a gene  which is encoded in the genetic code  in general  the genetic code specifies 20 standard amino acids  but in certain organisms the genetic code can include selenocysteine and in certain archaea pyrrolysine  shortly after or even during synthesis  the residues in a protein are often chemically modified by post translational modification  which alters the physical and chemical properties  folding  stability  activity  and ultimately  the function of the proteins  some proteins have non peptide groups attached  which can be called prosthetic groups or cofactors  proteins can also work together to achieve a particular function  and they often associate to form stable protein complexes   once formed  proteins only exist for a certain period and are then degraded and recycled by the cell s machinery through the process of protein turnover  a protein s lifespan is measured in terms of its half life and covers a wide range  they can exist for minutes or years with an average lifespan of 1–2 days in mammalian cells  abnormal or misfolded proteins are degraded more rapidly either due to being targeted for destruction or due to being unstable   like other biological macromolecules such as polysaccharides and nucleic acids  proteins are essential parts of organisms and participate in virtually every process within cells  many proteins are enzymes that catalyse biochemical reactions and are vital to metabolism  proteins also have structural or mechanical functions  such as actin and myosin in muscle and the proteins in the cytoskeleton  which form a system of scaffolding that maintains cell shape  other proteins are important in cell signaling  immune responses  cell adhesion  and the cell cycle  in animals  proteins are needed in the diet to provide the essential amino acids that cannot be synthesized  digestion breaks the proteins down for use in the metabolism   proteins may be purified from other cellular components using a variety of techniques such as ultracentrifugation  precipitation  electrophoresis  and chromatography  the advent of genetic engineering has made possible a number of methods to facilitate purification  methods commonly used to study protein structure and function include immunohistochemistry  site directed mutagenesis  x ray crystallography  nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry          history and etymology       proteins were recognized as a distinct class of biological molecules in the eighteenth century by antoine fourcroy and others  distinguished by the molecules  ability to coagulate or flocculate under treatments with heat or acid  noted examples at the time included albumin from egg whites  blood serum albumin  fibrin  and wheat gluten   proteins were first described by the dutch chemist gerardus johannes mulder and named by the swedish chemist jöns jacob berzelius in 1838  mulder carried out elemental analysis of common proteins and found that nearly all proteins had the same empirical formula  c400h620n100o120p1s1  he came to the erroneous conclusion that they might be composed of a single type of  very large  molecule  the term  protein  to describe these molecules was proposed by mulder s associate berzelius  protein is derived from the greek word πρώτειος  proteios   meaning  primary    in the lead   or  standing in front      in  mulder went on to identify the products of protein degradation such as the amino acid leucine for which he found a  nearly correct  molecular weight of 131 da  prior to  protein   other names were used  like  albumins  or  albuminous materials   eiweisskörper  in german  early nutritional scientists such as the german carl von voit believed that protein was the most important nutrient for maintaining the structure of the body  because it was generally believed that  flesh makes flesh   karl heinrich ritthausen extended known protein forms with the identification of glutamic acid  at the connecticut agricultural experiment station a detailed review of the vegetable proteins was compiled by thomas burr osborne  working with lafayette mendel and applying liebig s law of the minimum in feeding laboratory rats  the nutritionally essential amino acids were established  the work was continued and communicated by william cumming rose  the understanding of proteins as polypeptides came through the work of franz hofmeister and hermann emil fischer in 1902  the central role of proteins as enzymes in living organisms was not fully appreciated until 1926  when james b  sumner showed that the enzyme urease was in fact a protein the difficulty in purifying proteins in large quantities made them very difficult for early protein biochemists to study  hence  early studies focused on proteins that could be purified in large quantities  e g   those of blood  egg white  various toxins  and digestive metabolic enzymes obtained from slaughterhouses  in the 1950s  the armour hot dog co  purified 1 kg of pure bovine pancreatic ribonuclease a and made it freely available to scientists  this gesture helped ribonuclease a become a major target for biochemical study for the following decades     linus pauling is credited with the successful prediction of regular protein secondary structures based on hydrogen bonding  an idea first put forth by william astbury in 1933  later work by walter kauzmann on denaturation  based partly on previous studies by kaj linderstrøm lang  contributed an understanding of protein folding and structure mediated by hydrophobic interactions   the first protein to be sequenced was insulin  by frederick sanger  in 1949  sanger correctly determined the amino acid sequence of insulin  thus conclusively demonstrating that proteins consisted of linear polymers of amino acids rather than branched chains  colloids  or cyclols  he won the nobel prize for this achievement in 1958 the first protein structures to be solved were hemoglobin and myoglobin  by max perutz and sir john cowdery kendrew  respectively  in 1958  as of 2017  the protein data bank has over 126 060 atomic resolution structures of proteins  in more recent times  cryo electron microscopy of large macromolecular assemblies and computational protein structure prediction of small protein domains are two methods approaching atomic resolution          biochemistry       most proteins consist of linear polymers built from series of up to 20 different l α  amino acids  all proteinogenic amino acids possess common structural features  including an α carbon to which an amino group  a carboxyl group  and a variable side chain are bonded  only proline differs from this basic structure as it contains an unusual ring to the n end amine group  which forces the co–nh amide moiety into a fixed conformation  the side chains of the standard amino acids  detailed in the list of standard amino acids  have a great variety of chemical structures and properties  it is the combined effect of all of the amino acid side chains in a protein that ultimately determines its three dimensional structure and its chemical reactivity   the amino acids in a polypeptide chain are linked by peptide bonds  once linked in the protein chain  an individual amino acid is called a residue  and the linked series of carbon  nitrogen  and oxygen atoms are known as the main chain or protein backbone the peptide bond has two resonance forms that contribute some double bond character and inhibit rotation around its axis  so that the alpha carbons are roughly coplanar  the other two dihedral angles in the peptide bond determine the local shape assumed by the protein backbone  the end with a free amino group is known as the n terminus or amino terminus  whereas the end of the protein with a free carboxyl group is known as the c terminus or carboxy terminus  the sequence of the protein is written from n terminus to c terminus  from left to right    the words protein  polypeptide  and peptide are a little ambiguous and can overlap in meaning  protein is generally used to refer to the complete biological molecule in a stable conformation  whereas peptide is generally reserved for a short amino acid oligomers often lacking a stable 3d structure  but the boundary between the two is not well defined and usually lies near 20–30 residues  polypeptide can refer to any single linear chain of amino acids  usually regardless of length  but often implies an absence of a defined conformation           interactions      proteins can interact with many types of molecules  including with other proteins  with lipids  with carboyhydrates  and with dna           abundance in cells      it has been estimated that average sized bacteria contain about 2 million proteins per cell  e g  e  coli and staphylococcus aureus   smaller bacteria  such as mycoplasma or spirochetes contain fewer molecules  on the order of 50 000 to 1 million  by contrast  eukaryotic cells are larger and thus contain much more protein  for instance  yeast cells have been estimated to contain about 50 million proteins and human cells on the order of 1 to 3 billion  the concentration of individual protein copies ranges from a few molecules per cell up to  20 million  not all genes coding proteins are expressed in most cells and their number depends on  for example  cell type and external stimuli  for instance  of the 20 000 or so proteins encoded by the human genome  only 6 000 are detected in lymphoblastoid cells  moreover  the number of proteins the genome encodes correlates well with the organism complexity  eukaryotes have 15 000  bacteria have 3 200  archaea have 2 400  and viruses have 42 proteins on average coded in their respective genomes          synthesis             biosynthesis        proteins are assembled from amino acids using information encoded in genes  each protein has its own unique amino acid sequence that is specified by the nucleotide sequence of the gene encoding this protein  the genetic code is a set of three nucleotide sets called codons and each three nucleotide combination designates an amino acid  for example aug  adenine–uracil–guanine  is the code for methionine  because dna contains four nucleotides  the total number of possible codons is 64  hence  there is some redundancy in the genetic code  with some amino acids specified by more than one codon  genes encoded in dna are first transcribed into pre messenger rna  mrna  by proteins such as rna polymerase  most organisms then process the pre mrna  also known as a primary transcript  using various forms of post transcriptional modification to form the mature mrna  which is then used as a template for protein synthesis by the ribosome  in prokaryotes the mrna may either be used as soon as it is produced  or be bound by a ribosome after having moved away from the nucleoid  in contrast  eukaryotes make mrna in the cell nucleus and then translocate it across the nuclear membrane into the cytoplasm  where protein synthesis then takes place  the rate of protein synthesis is higher in prokaryotes than eukaryotes and can reach up to 20 amino acids per second the process of synthesizing a protein from an mrna template is known as translation  the mrna is loaded onto the ribosome and is read three nucleotides at a time by matching each codon to its base pairing anticodon located on a transfer rna molecule  which carries the amino acid corresponding to the codon it recognizes  the enzyme aminoacyl trna synthetase  charges  the trna molecules with the correct amino acids  the growing polypeptide is often termed the nascent chain  proteins are always biosynthesized from n terminus to c terminus the size of a synthesized protein can be measured by the number of amino acids it contains and by its total molecular mass  which is normally reported in units of daltons  synonymous with atomic mass units   or the derivative unit kilodalton  kda   the average size of a protein increases from archaea to bacteria to eukaryote  283  311  438 residues and 31  34  49 kda respectively  due to a bigger number of protein domains constituting proteins in higher organisms  for instance  yeast proteins are on average 466 amino acids long and 53 kda in mass  the largest known proteins are the titins  a component of the muscle sarcomere  with a molecular mass of almost 3 000 kda and a total length of almost 27 000 amino acids           chemical synthesis        short proteins can also be synthesized chemically by a family of methods known as peptide synthesis  which rely on organic synthesis techniques such as chemical ligation to produce peptides in high yield  chemical synthesis allows for the introduction of non natural amino acids into polypeptide chains  such as attachment of fluorescent probes to amino acid side chains  these methods are useful in laboratory biochemistry and cell biology  though generally not for commercial applications  chemical synthesis is inefficient for polypeptides longer than about 300 amino acids  and the synthesized proteins may not readily assume their native tertiary structure  most chemical synthesis methods proceed from c terminus to n terminus  opposite the biological reaction          structure       most proteins fold into unique 3d structures  the shape into which a protein naturally folds is known as its native conformation  although many proteins can fold unassisted  simply through the chemical properties of their amino acids  others require the aid of molecular chaperones to fold into their native states  biochemists often refer to four distinct aspects of a protein s structure   primary structure  the amino acid sequence  a protein is a polyamide   secondary structure  regularly repeating local structures stabilized by hydrogen bonds  the most common examples are the α helix  β sheet and turns  because secondary structures are local  many regions of different secondary structure can be present in the same protein molecule   tertiary structure  the overall shape of a single protein molecule  the spatial relationship of the secondary structures to one another  tertiary structure is generally stabilized by nonlocal interactions  most commonly the formation of a hydrophobic core  but also through salt bridges  hydrogen bonds  disulfide bonds  and even posttranslational modifications  the term  tertiary structure  is often used as synonymous with the term fold  the tertiary structure is what controls the basic function of the protein   quaternary structure  the structure formed by several protein molecules  polypeptide chains   usually called protein subunits in this context  which function as a single protein complex   quinary structure  the signatures of protein surface that organize the crowded cellular interior  quinary structure is dependent on transient  yet essential  macromolecular interactions that occur inside living cells proteins are not entirely rigid molecules  in addition to these levels of structure  proteins may shift between several related structures while they perform their functions  in the context of these functional rearrangements  these tertiary or quaternary structures are usually referred to as  conformations   and transitions between them are called conformational changes  such changes are often induced by the binding of a substrate molecule to an enzyme s active site  or the physical region of the protein that participates in chemical catalysis  in solution proteins also undergo variation in structure through thermal vibration and the collision with other molecules     proteins can be informally divided into three main classes  which correlate with typical tertiary structures  globular proteins  fibrous proteins  and membrane proteins  almost all globular proteins are soluble and many are enzymes  fibrous proteins are often structural  such as collagen  the major component of connective tissue  or keratin  the protein component of hair and nails  membrane proteins often serve as receptors or provide channels for polar or charged molecules to pass through the cell membrane a special case of intramolecular hydrogen bonds within proteins  poorly shielded from water attack and hence promoting their own dehydration  are called dehydrons           protein domains        many proteins are composed of several protein domains  i e  segments of a protein that fold into distinct structural units  domains usually also have specific functions  such as enzymatic activities  e g  kinase  or they serve as binding modules  e g  the sh3 domain binds to proline rich sequences in other proteins            sequence motif      short amino acid sequences within proteins often act as recognition sites for other proteins  for instance  sh3 domains typically bind to short pxxp motifs  i e  2 prolines  p   separated by two unspecified amino acids  x   although the surrounding amino acids may determine the exact binding specificity   many such motifs has been collected in the eukaryotic linear motif  elm  database          cellular functions     proteins are the chief actors within the cell  said to be carrying out the duties specified by the information encoded in genes  with the exception of certain types of rna  most other biological molecules are relatively inert elements upon which proteins act  proteins make up half the dry weight of an escherichia coli cell  whereas other macromolecules such as dna and rna make up only 3  and 20   respectively  the set of proteins expressed in a particular cell or cell type is known as its proteome     the chief characteristic of proteins that also allows their diverse set of functions is their ability to bind other molecules specifically and tightly  the region of the protein responsible for binding another molecule is known as the binding site and is often a depression or  pocket  on the molecular surface  this binding ability is mediated by the tertiary structure of the protein  which defines the binding site pocket  and by the chemical properties of the surrounding amino acids  side chains  protein binding can be extraordinarily tight and specific  for example  the ribonuclease inhibitor protein binds to human angiogenin with a sub femtomolar dissociation constant   10−15 m  but does not bind at all to its amphibian homolog onconase   1 m   extremely minor chemical changes such as the addition of a single methyl group to a binding partner can sometimes suffice to nearly eliminate binding  for example  the aminoacyl trna synthetase specific to the amino acid valine discriminates against the very similar side chain of the amino acid isoleucine proteins can bind to other proteins as well as to small molecule substrates  when proteins bind specifically to other copies of the same molecule  they can oligomerize to form fibrils  this process occurs often in structural proteins that consist of globular monomers that self associate to form rigid fibers  protein–protein interactions also regulate enzymatic activity  control progression through the cell cycle  and allow the assembly of large protein complexes that carry out many closely related reactions with a common biological function  proteins can also bind to  or even be integrated into  cell membranes  the ability of binding partners to induce conformational changes in proteins allows the construction of enormously complex signaling networks   as interactions between proteins are reversible  and depend heavily on the availability of different groups of partner proteins to form aggregates that are capable to carry out discrete sets of function  study of the interactions between specific proteins is a key to understand important aspects of cellular function  and ultimately the properties that distinguish particular cell types           enzymes        the best known role of proteins in the cell is as enzymes  which catalyse chemical reactions  enzymes are usually highly specific and accelerate only one or a few chemical reactions  enzymes carry out most of the reactions involved in metabolism  as well as manipulating dna in processes such as dna replication  dna repair  and transcription  some enzymes act on other proteins to add or remove chemical groups in a process known as posttranslational modification  about 4 000 reactions are known to be catalysed by enzymes  the rate acceleration conferred by enzymatic catalysis is often enormous as much as 1017 fold increase in rate over the uncatalysed reaction in the case of orotate decarboxylase  78 million years without the enzyme  18 milliseconds with the enzyme  the molecules bound and acted upon by enzymes are called substrates  although enzymes can consist of hundreds of amino acids  it is usually only a small fraction of the residues that come in contact with the substrate  and an even smaller fraction three to four residues on average that are directly involved in catalysis  the region of the enzyme that binds the substrate and contains the catalytic residues is known as the active site   dirigent proteins are members of a class of proteins that dictate the stereochemistry of a compound synthesized by other enzymes           cell signaling and ligand binding        many proteins are involved in the process of cell signaling and signal transduction  some proteins  such as insulin  are extracellular proteins that transmit a signal from the cell in which they were synthesized to other cells in distant tissues  others are membrane proteins that act as receptors whose main function is to bind a signaling molecule and induce a biochemical response in the cell  many receptors have a binding site exposed on the cell surface and an effector domain within the cell  which may have enzymatic activity or may undergo a conformational change detected by other proteins within the cell antibodies are protein components of an adaptive immune system whose main function is to bind antigens  or foreign substances in the body  and target them for destruction  antibodies can be secreted into the extracellular environment or anchored in the membranes of specialized b cells known as plasma cells  whereas enzymes are limited in their binding affinity for their substrates by the necessity of conducting their reaction  antibodies have no such constraints  an antibody s binding affinity to its target is extraordinarily high many ligand transport proteins bind particular small biomolecules and transport them to other locations in the body of a multicellular organism  these proteins must have a high binding affinity when their ligand is present in high concentrations  but must also release the ligand when it is present at low concentrations in the target tissues  the canonical example of a ligand binding protein is haemoglobin  which transports oxygen from the lungs to other organs and tissues in all vertebrates and has close homologs in every biological kingdom  lectins are sugar binding proteins which are highly specific for their sugar moieties  lectins typically play a role in biological recognition phenomena involving cells and proteins  receptors and hormones are highly specific binding proteins   transmembrane proteins can also serve as ligand transport proteins that alter the permeability of the cell membrane to small molecules and ions  the membrane alone has a hydrophobic core through which polar or charged molecules cannot diffuse  membrane proteins contain internal channels that allow such molecules to enter and exit the cell  many ion channel proteins are specialized to select for only a particular ion  for example  potassium and sodium channels often discriminate for only one of the two ions           structural proteins      structural proteins confer stiffness and rigidity to otherwise fluid biological components  most structural proteins are fibrous proteins  for example  collagen and elastin are critical components of connective tissue such as cartilage  and keratin is found in hard or filamentous structures such as hair  nails  feathers  hooves  and some animal shells  some globular proteins can also play structural functions  for example  actin and tubulin are globular and soluble as monomers  but polymerize to form long  stiff fibers that make up the cytoskeleton  which allows the cell to maintain its shape and size   other proteins that serve structural functions are motor proteins such as myosin  kinesin  and dynein  which are capable of generating mechanical forces  these proteins are crucial for cellular motility of single celled organisms and the sperm of many multicellular organisms which reproduce sexually  they also generate the forces exerted by contracting muscles and play essential roles in intracellular transport          methods of study       the activities and structures of proteins may be examined in vitro  in vivo  and in silico  in vitro studies of purified proteins in controlled environments are useful for learning how a protein carries out its function  for example  enzyme kinetics studies explore the chemical mechanism of an enzyme s catalytic activity and its relative affinity for various possible substrate molecules  by contrast  in vivo experiments can provide information about the physiological role of a protein in the context of a cell or even a whole organism  in silico studies use computational methods to study proteins           protein purification        to perform in vitro analysis  a protein must be purified away from other cellular components  this process usually begins with cell lysis  in which a cell s membrane is disrupted and its internal contents released into a solution known as a crude lysate  the resulting mixture can be purified using ultracentrifugation  which fractionates the various cellular components into fractions containing soluble proteins  membrane lipids and proteins  cellular organelles  and nucleic acids  precipitation by a method known as salting out can concentrate the proteins from this lysate  various types of chromatography are then used to isolate the protein or proteins of interest based on properties such as molecular weight  net charge and binding affinity  the level of purification can be monitored using various types of gel electrophoresis if the desired protein s molecular weight and isoelectric point are known  by spectroscopy if the protein has distinguishable spectroscopic features  or by enzyme assays if the protein has enzymatic activity  additionally  proteins can be isolated according to their charge using electrofocusing for natural proteins  a series of purification steps may be necessary to obtain protein sufficiently pure for laboratory applications  to simplify this process  genetic engineering is often used to add chemical features to proteins that make them easier to purify without affecting their structure or activity  here  a  tag  consisting of a specific amino acid sequence  often a series of histidine residues  a  his tag    is attached to one terminus of the protein  as a result  when the lysate is passed over a chromatography column containing nickel  the histidine residues ligate the nickel and attach to the column while the untagged components of the lysate pass unimpeded  a number of different tags have been developed to help researchers purify specific proteins from complex mixtures           cellular localization        the study of proteins in vivo is often concerned with the synthesis and localization of the protein within the cell  although many intracellular proteins are synthesized in the cytoplasm and membrane bound or secreted proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum  the specifics of how proteins are targeted to specific organelles or cellular structures is often unclear  a useful technique for assessing cellular localization uses genetic engineering to express in a cell a fusion protein or chimera consisting of the natural protein of interest linked to a  reporter  such as green fluorescent protein  gfp   the fused protein s position within the cell can be cleanly and efficiently visualized using microscopy  as shown in the figure opposite   other methods for elucidating the cellular location of proteins requires the use of known compartmental markers for regions such as the er  the golgi  lysosomes or vacuoles  mitochondria  chloroplasts  plasma membrane  etc  with the use of fluorescently tagged versions of these markers or of antibodies to known markers  it becomes much simpler to identify the localization of a protein of interest  for example  indirect immunofluorescence will allow for fluorescence colocalization and demonstration of location  fluorescent dyes are used to label cellular compartments for a similar purpose other possibilities exist  as well  for example  immunohistochemistry usually utilizes an antibody to one or more proteins of interest that are conjugated to enzymes yielding either luminescent or chromogenic signals that can be compared between samples  allowing for localization information  another applicable technique is cofractionation in sucrose  or other material  gradients using isopycnic centrifugation  while this technique does not prove colocalization of a compartment of known density and the protein of interest  it does increase the likelihood  and is more amenable to large scale studies   finally  the gold standard method of cellular localization is immunoelectron microscopy  this technique also uses an antibody to the protein of interest  along with classical electron microscopy techniques  the sample is prepared for normal electron microscopic examination  and then treated with an antibody to the protein of interest that is conjugated to an extremely electro dense material  usually gold  this allows for the localization of both ultrastructural details as well as the protein of interest through another genetic engineering application known as site directed mutagenesis  researchers can alter the protein sequence and hence its structure  cellular localization  and susceptibility to regulation  this technique even allows the incorporation of unnatural amino acids into proteins  using modified trnas  and may allow the rational design of new proteins with novel properties           proteomics        the total complement of proteins present at a time in a cell or cell type is known as its proteome  and the study of such large scale data sets defines the field of proteomics  named by analogy to the related field of genomics  key experimental techniques in proteomics include 2d electrophoresis  which allows the separation of many proteins  mass spectrometry  which allows rapid high throughput identification of proteins and sequencing of peptides  most often after in gel digestion   protein microarrays  which allow the detection of the relative levels of the various proteins present in a cell  and two hybrid screening  which allows the systematic exploration of protein–protein interactions  the total complement of biologically possible such interactions is known as the interactome  a systematic attempt to determine the structures of proteins representing every possible fold is known as structural genomics           bioinformatics        a vast array of computational methods have been developed to analyze the structure  function and evolution of proteins   the development of such tools has been driven by the large amount of genomic and proteomic data available for a variety of organisms  including the human genome  it is simply impossible to study all proteins experimentally  hence only a few are subjected to laboratory experiments while computational tools are used to extrapolate to similar proteins  such homologous proteins can be efficiently identified in distantly related organisms by sequence alignment  genome and gene sequences can be searched by a variety of tools for certain properties  sequence profiling tools can find restriction enzyme sites  open reading frames in nucleotide sequences  and predict secondary structures  phylogenetic trees can be constructed and evolutionary hypotheses developed using special software like clustalw regarding the ancestry of modern organisms and the genes they express  the field of bioinformatics is now indispensable for the analysis of genes and proteins           structure determination      discovering the tertiary structure of a protein  or the quaternary structure of its complexes  can provide important clues about how the protein performs its function and how it can be affected  i e  in drug design  as proteins are too small to be seen under a light microscope  other methods have to be employed to determine their structure  common experimental methods include x ray crystallography and nmr spectroscopy  both of which can produce structural information at atomic resolution  however  nmr experiments are able to provide information from which a subset of distances between pairs of atoms can be estimated  and the final possible conformations for a protein are determined by solving a distance geometry problem  dual polarisation interferometry is a quantitative analytical method for measuring the overall protein conformation and conformational changes due to interactions or other stimulus  circular dichroism is another laboratory technique for determining internal β sheet   α helical composition of proteins  cryoelectron microscopy is used to produce lower resolution structural information about very large protein complexes  including assembled viruses  a variant known as electron crystallography can also produce high resolution information in some cases  especially for two dimensional crystals of membrane proteins  solved structures are usually deposited in the protein data bank  pdb   a freely available resource from which structural data about thousands of proteins can be obtained in the form of cartesian coordinates for each atom in the protein many more gene sequences are known than protein structures  further  the set of solved structures is biased toward proteins that can be easily subjected to the conditions required in x ray crystallography  one of the major structure determination methods  in particular  globular proteins are comparatively easy to crystallize in preparation for x ray crystallography  membrane proteins and large protein complexes  by contrast  are difficult to crystallize and are underrepresented in the pdb  structural genomics initiatives have attempted to remedy these deficiencies by systematically solving representative structures of major fold classes  protein structure prediction methods attempt to provide a means of generating a plausible structure for proteins whose structures have not been experimentally determined           structure prediction and simulation        complementary to the field of structural genomics  protein structure prediction develops efficient mathematical models of proteins to computationally predict the molecular formations in theory  instead of detecting structures with laboratory observation  the most successful type of structure prediction  known as homology modeling  relies on the existence of a  template  structure with sequence similarity to the protein being modeled  structural genomics  goal is to provide sufficient representation in solved structures to model most of those that remain  although producing accurate models remains a challenge when only distantly related template structures are available  it has been suggested that sequence alignment is the bottleneck in this process  as quite accurate models can be produced if a  perfect  sequence alignment is known  many structure prediction methods have served to inform the emerging field of protein engineering  in which novel protein folds have already been designed  a more complex computational problem is the prediction of intermolecular interactions  such as in molecular docking and protein–protein interaction prediction mathematical models to simulate dynamic processes of protein folding and binding involve molecular mechanics  in particular  molecular dynamics  monte carlo techniques facilitate the computations  which exploit advances in parallel and distributed computing  for example  the folding home project which performs molecular modeling on gpus   in silico simulations discovered the folding of small α helical protein domains such as the villin headpiece and the hiv accessory protein  hybrid methods combining standard molecular dynamics with quantum mechanical mathematics explored the electronic states of rhodopsins            protein disorder and unstructure prediction       many proteins  in eucaryota  33   contain large unstructured but biologically functional segments and can be classified as intrinsically disordered proteins  predicting and analysing protein disorder is  therefore  an important part of protein structure characterisation          nutrition       most microorganisms and plants can biosynthesize all 20 standard amino acids  while animals  including humans  must obtain some of the amino acids from the diet  the amino acids that an organism cannot synthesize on its own are referred to as essential amino acids  key enzymes that synthesize certain amino acids are not present in animals such as aspartokinase  which catalyses the first step in the synthesis of lysine  methionine  and threonine from aspartate  if amino acids are present in the environment  microorganisms can conserve energy by taking up the amino acids from their surroundings and downregulating their biosynthetic pathways   in animals  amino acids are obtained through the consumption of foods containing protein  ingested proteins are then broken down into amino acids through digestion  which typically involves denaturation of the protein through exposure to acid and hydrolysis by enzymes called proteases  some ingested amino acids are used for protein biosynthesis  while others are converted to glucose through gluconeogenesis  or fed into the citric acid cycle  this use of protein as a fuel is particularly important under starvation conditions as it allows the body s own proteins to be used to support life  particularly those found in muscle in animals such as dogs and cats  protein maintains the health and quality of the skin by promoting hair follicle growth and keratinization  and thus reducing the likelihood of skin problems producing malodours  poor quality proteins also have a role regarding gastrointestinal health  increasing the potential for flatulence and odorous compounds in dogs because when proteins reach the colon in an undigested state  they are fermented producing hydrogen sulfide gas  indole  and skatole  dogs and cats digest animal proteins better than those from plants  but products of low quality animal origin are poorly digested  including skin  feathers  and connective tissue          see also            references            textbooks            external links             databases and
